# Project: Virtual Piano
### About
One of the many things that a front-end developer has to take care of is binding the functionality of the web application to the keys on the keyboard. The mouse is easy to operate, but it's not enough, because some things are more convenient to do with the keyboard — for example, refresh a page in the browser. It is also very important to make your product available to a variety of users, including those with physical disabilities. People with poor eyesight and/or impaired fine motor skills learn about the content of sites literally through touch. Switching between keyboard and mouse plays a vital role when using programs to sound text on the screen and navigating sites. These programs make the information on the web more accessible for people with disabilities. In order to develop and strengthen the important skills of working with keyboard keys, in this project we will make a virtual piano — perhaps this is one of the most creative and enjoyable ways to learn!
### Learning outcomes
You will learn how to write markup HTML documents and practice the most popular CSS properties. You will also learn how to use JavaScript to make event handlers for browser events, create and insert new elements into the document. Three useful technologies in a single project!
### This project is a part of the following track
Web Developer
## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
### Stage 1/5: Add markup
First, you need to add some elements to the body of the HTML document. We'll learn to work with tags responsible for the characters entered by the user on the keyboard.
### Stage 2/5: Page styling
This stage is an opportunity to improve the visual presentation of your piano and implement it yourself. Our goal is not just an interesting application, but a unique application.
### Stage 3/5: Application functionality
Learn how to create events that occur as a result of keystrokes on the keyboard.
### Stage 4/5: Let there be music
Music can create a very special atmosphere. Let's teach our musical instrument how to actually produce sound.
### Stage 5/5: Adding and styling new keys
The name of the stage speaks for itself: create new keys and customize them. We're done!
